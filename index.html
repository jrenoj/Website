            Hi! My name is Jonathan. I'm a third year Data Science student at the University of California, Berkeley. 
            I graduated from Los Angeles City College in the spring of 2023 with 3 Associates of Science degrees in Economics, 
            Mathematics, & Natural Sciences. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA, but I spent a lot of time traveling 
            back to Guatemala for the summers.
       
            I'm looking to develop my skills in machine learning, statistics, and software engineering. I'm actively learning new concetps 
            in and out of school in order to better improve my skills to prepare myself for the workforce. My skillset is focused on 
            analyzing large datasets and performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Machine Learning. Feel free to check my resume to 
            look at my skills and experience!

            My interests and hobbies are all over the place, but my main passions are coding, music, statistics/math, and traveling. I'm a 
            classicaly trained guitarist, but I also enjoy playing piano, electric bass and singing. My love for statistics and math began
            when I took AP Stats in High School. I instantly fell in love with it, and I wanted to further pursue it as a career. I discovered 
            data science through the internet and I thought it was the perfect combination of my love for computers and my love for statistics.

            If you would like to contact me, feel free to contact me via email:
