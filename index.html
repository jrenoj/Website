            Hi! My name is Jonathan. I'm a third year Data Science student at the University of California, Berkeley. 
            I graduated from Los Angeles City College in the spring of 2023 with 3 Associates of Science degrees in Economics, 
            Mathematics, & Natural Sciences. 

            If you're looking to get in contact with me, LinkedIn is my preferred choice for communication. I will happily provide 
            any further contact information from there :D

            I'm looking to develop my skills in machine learning, statistics, and software engineering. I'm actively learning new concetps 
            in and out of school in order to better improve my skills to prepare myself for the workforce. My skillset is focused on 
            analyzing large datasets and performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Machine Learning.

            Python is my main langauge, but I also know Java - and mess around with C++. I have some ideas for some projects I want to implement so please
            keep checking back in a couple of weeks/months to see my progress and implementations.

            I run Ubuntu Linux on my machine, and I'm interested in creating and contributing to free and open-source software projects.
